# bash-script

**convergence-check.sh** is a bash script file checks if the energy and forces on a FLOSIC (Fermi–Löwdin self-interaction correction) calculations are converged. 

**get-energy.sh** produces an output file that gives the total energies and the atomization energies of the AE6 set. Atomization energies referrs to the energy required to break a molecule into its constituent atoms.
